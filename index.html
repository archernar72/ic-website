            <h2>Fractional CIO/IT Director</h2>
            <p>Most businesses would benefit from strategic leadership around Technology and Data.</p>
            <p>In the SME space, it is often difficult to justify the expense of a permanent employee to lead the IT function, provide the strategic direction, and act as the subject matter expert to the board and management team.</p>
            <p>Our Fractional CIO/IT Director service addresses the needs of an SME business where technology is key to operations, but not necessarily core to why the business exists. We work with your business in a flexible and responsive way, with as much or as little resource as you need as the business grows, changes, and develops.</p>
            <p>We may work with you on a specific project – say the implementation of a new system or integration, or a review of your technology architecture. We can manage the delivery of solutions, act as your trusted technology adviser, and as a key part of your management team. We will undertake service reviews, supplier negotiation and management. A Fractional CIO/IT Director can help whatever your business needs from technology.</p>
            <p>If having a senior, experienced, and flexible IT Leader is of interest, without the usual hassles of recruitment and costs of employment, please get in touch. We’d love to work with you.</p>
